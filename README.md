# mscAero
Any project that is related to my master in Aerodynamics 

In this repo, all my "polished" university projects are posted. Currently it includes a PIV image processor, a 2d potential flow solver, and a lifting line model for rotor configurations. I plan on adding new projects in the coming months, such as finite volume solvers for hyperbolic systems, a 2d navier stokes solver, and projects foccusing on parallel processing (poisson solver, finite element method).

At the moment, all my projects are in matlab, but the future projects will also be written in python and C.
